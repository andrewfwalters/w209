    Tracking Macro-Nutrients
  </h2>
  <p>
    A popular way to track daily nutrition is to record their macronutrients (carbohyrates, fats, and proteins).
    For many people, recording each macro is only slightly more work than counting calories but provides much more information.
    The dataset used in this visualization is just a json array with for fields per entry: grams of carbs, fats, and protiens and the date.
  </p>
  <p>
    A typical user of this vizualization would be a person who has been tracking macros and needs an overview of their dietary progress.
    While this tool doesn't provide the ability to upload your own data, a production system would have that ability.
    A user would likely be concerned with two main issues - their total calorie load and their macro ratios.
    The total calorie load is the amount of calories consumed in a day.
    The macro ratio is the fraction of the calorie load composed of each macronutrient, which is the most important dietary factor in body composition after calorie load.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary task for this visualization is to get an overview of the large quantity of information.
    The data is broken out by day, the smallest unit of measurement, in a calendar layout that is familiar and intuitive to users.
    A user could quickly identify broad trends, like an increase or decrease in calorie load over time.
    The closeness of the datapoints allows for a broader picture to stand out simply drawing the eye to concentrations or lack of color.
    The average days are less noticeable by comparison.
